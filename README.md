suapp
=====

Repo for an application being built aimed at letting Student Union members of a college connect easily with its student board.

### Tips

[Phonegap](http://phonegap.com/install/) must be installed.

To deploy suapp to an android device navigate to the project directory and use:
 `phonegap local run android`
 (An emulutor/phone must be running)

Optionally you can build and install the app seperately:
`phonegap local build android`
`phonegap local install android`
